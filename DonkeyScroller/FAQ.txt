Q: 
DonkeyScroller... what?

A: 
Years ago, I started writing a IRC client in Visual Basic. To my aid I had the source code
for Visual IRC written in Delphi/Pascal. Among its controls was MonkeyScroller, the chat view.
I simply based my control on theirs and called it IrcChatView for years to come.
Now with this rewrite, I call it DonkeyScroller because I think it sounds funny.

Q:
So, it is a clone of MonkeyScroller?

A:
Yes and no. My early ports were quite similar, albeit broken in most aspects. 
I've written the control from scratch so many times in many different languages 
and it has evolved to something different, but has it's roots in MonkeyScroller.

Q:
Can you add feature XYZ?

A:
Maybe, pitch me your idea.

Q:
Can you add support for emojis?

A:
Thats what you got ASCII smileys for ;-)
In all seriousness, this would require a massive rewrite of the rendering and text selection code
and I'm not to keen on that.

Q:
Can I add images to the view?

A:
As with emojis, there would be too much code to rewrite.
You can however add a "icon" for lines that appears to the left of the text

Q:
I found a bug, what can I do?

A:
If you wrote a fix for it, I can have a look at it.
If you just found the bug but want me to look at it, please describe as detailed as possible, perhaps a write a small demo application?

Q:
I wrote some new features for DonkeyScroller, want them?

A:
Maybe, depends on what kind of features, pitch me your features.

Q:
What license applies to DonkeyScroller?

A:
MIT License, https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

Q:
My question is not answered here, what now?

A:
Send me an email with your question.
Right of the bat though, I will NOT write code for you, I will NOT help you with your application.
